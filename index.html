          <h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
          <p>
            A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared
            among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain
            stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are
            best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as
            Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of
            transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees
            the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust
            without the need for a trusted third party.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is
            how the data is structured. A blockchain collects information
            together in groups, known as blocks, that hold sets of information.
            Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed
            and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data
            known as the blockchain. All new information that follows that
            freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will
            then also be added to the chain once filled.
          </p>
          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul class="keylist">
            <li>
              Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a
              typical database in the way that it stores information;
              blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via
              cryptography.
            </li>
            <li>
              As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the
              block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block,
              which makes the data chained together in chronological order.
            </li>
            <li>
              Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but
              the most common use so far has been as a ledger for transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              In Bitcoin‚Äôs case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so
              that no single person or group has control‚Äîrather, all users
              collectively retain control.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data
              entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions
              are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Does a Blockchain Work?</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be
            recorded and distributed, but not edited. In this way, a blockchain
            is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of transactions
            that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. This is why
            blockchains are also known as a distributed ledger technology (DLT).
          </p>
          <p>
            First proposed as a research project in 1991, the blockchain concept
            predated its first widespread application in use: Bitcoin, in 2009.
            In the years since, the use of blockchains has exploded via the
            creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi)
            applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.
